    subgraph User
        A1(Start) --> A2[Fill Registration Form]
        A2 --> A3[Submit Form]
    end

    subgraph System
        A3 --> B1[Validate Data]
        B1 --> B2{Is Data Valid?}
        B2 -- No --> B3[Show Error]
        B2 -- Yes --> B4[Create Account]
        B4 --> B5[Send Verification Email]
        B5 --> A4[End]
    end


Explanation
This workflow captures the registration process. It ensures data validity before creating an account. The system sends a verification email to complete the process. This ensures secure onboarding, aligning with the security stakeholder requirement.

Workflow 2: Submit Recovery Request

        A2 --> A3[Submit Request]
    end

    subgraph System
        A3 --> B1[Check Dependencies]
        B1 --> B2{All Requirements Met?}
        B2 -- No --> B3[Show Missing Info]
        B2 -- Yes --> B4[Forward to Reviewer]
        B4 --> A4[End]
    end

Explanation
This diagram handles submitting database recovery requests. Stakeholders are concerned about incomplete inputs; this workflow ensures validation before processing, improving reliability.

Workflow 3: Review and Approve Request

    subgraph Reviewer
        A1(Start) --> A2[Open Pending Request]
        A2 --> A3[Evaluate Details]
        A3 --> A4{Approve?}
        A4 -- Yes --> A5[Approve Request]
        A4 -- No --> A6[Reject Request]
        A5 --> A7[End]
        A6 --> A7
    end

Explanation
The approval process is critical for governance. It addresses concerns about unauthorized execution. This diagram supports traceability and accountability.

Workflow 4: Execute Recovery

    subgraph System
        A1(Start) --> A2[Prepare Recovery Environment]
        A2 --> A3[Restore Data from Backup]
        A3 --> A4{Success?}
        A4 -- No --> A5[Trigger Alert]
        A4 -- Yes --> A6[Run Validation Checks]
        A6 --> A7[Log Completion]
        A5 --> A7
        A7 --> A8[End]
    end

Explanation
This workflow safeguards successful recovery. It checks system restoration and logs results, meeting the system adminâ€™s need for transparency and error handling.

Workflow 5: Predict Failure

    subgraph System
        A1(Start) --> A2[Collect Monitoring Data]
        A2 --> A3[Apply AI Model]
        A3 --> A4{Failure Likely?}
        A4 -- No --> A5[Continue Monitoring]
        A4 -- Yes --> A6[Trigger Alert]
        A5 --> A7[End]
        A6 --> A7
    end

Explanation
This supports predictive maintenance. AI forecasts potential failures early, helping system admins mitigate risks proactively.

Workflow 6: Incident Management

        A1(Start) --> A2[Report Incident]
    end

    subgraph IT Team
        A2 --> B1[Assign Technician]
        B1 --> B2[Investigate Issue]
        B2 --> B3{Resolved?}
        B3 -- No --> B2
        B3 -- Yes --> B4[Close Incident]
        B4 --> A3[End]
    end

Explanation
This looped workflow handles incident management with continuous assessment until resolution. Meets operational continuity goals.

Workflow 7: Model Training

        A1(Start) --> A2[Prepare Training Data]
        A2 --> A3[Train AI Model]
        A3 --> A4[Evaluate Accuracy]
        A4 --> A5{Accuracy > 90%?}
        A5 -- Yes --> A6[Deploy Model]
        A5 -- No --> A7[Tune Parameters]
        A7 --> A3
        A6 --> A8[End]
    end

Explanation
This iteration-focused process ensures that AI models meet performance standards before deployment. Supports stakeholder concerns over false positives.

Workflow 8: Send Notifications
