Reflection

Working on the AI-Driven Automated Database Recovery System provided a valuable opportunity to bridge theoretical system design with practical, real-world applications in healthcare IT. By developing activity and state diagrams, we visualized complex workflows and object lifecycles, improving our understanding of system behavior under various conditions.

The traceability matrix helped ensure that every functional requirement and user story was directly supported by diagrams and system logic. This alignment strengthens system clarity, enhances stakeholder communication, and supports long-term maintainability.

Overall, this process highlighted the importance of detailed modeling and stakeholder-centered design when building critical infrastructure in sensitive environments like hospitals.
