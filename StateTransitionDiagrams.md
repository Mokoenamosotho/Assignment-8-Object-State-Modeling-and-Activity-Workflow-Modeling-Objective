# Object State Modeling with State Transition Diagrams 

Object 1: Database Instance
State Transition Diagram (Mermaid syntax):

stateDiagram
    [*] --> Running
    Running --> Recovering: Database failure
    Running --> BackingUp: Backup triggered
    Recovering --> Running: Recovery complete
    BackingUp --> Running: Backup successful
    Recovering --> Failed: Recovery failed
    Failed --> [*]

Explanation:
Key States:

Running: The database is operating normally.
Recovering: The database is being recovered after a failure.
BackingUp: The database is undergoing backup procedures.
Failed: The database recovery process failed.

Transitions:
Recovering: Triggered by a database failure event.
BackingUp: Triggered by a scheduled or manual backup request.
Recovery complete: Once the recovery process is completed, the database returns to "Running."
Backup successful: Once the backup is successfully completed, the database goes back to "Running."
Recovery failed: If the recovery process fails, the database moves to the "Failed" state.

Mapping to Functional Requirements:
The diagram supports FR-002 (Database Recovery) and FR-004 (Backup Process), where the system should be able to detect failures, recover from them, and handle regular backups.

Object 2: User Account
State Transition Diagram (Mermaid syntax):

stateDiagram
    [*] --> Active
    Active --> Suspended: Account flagged
    Suspended --> Active: Issue resolved
    Active --> Deactivated: User deletes account
    Deactivated --> [*]

Explanation:
Key States:

Active: The user account is active and usable.
Suspended: The user account is suspended due to suspicious activity or violation of policies.
Deactivated: The user has deactivated their account or it's no longer in use.

Transitions:
Suspended: Triggered when the account is flagged for suspicious activity.
Active: Triggered when the issue leading to suspension is resolved.
Deactivated: Triggered when the user chooses to deactivate or delete their account.

Mapping to Functional Requirements:
The diagram addresses FR-008 (Account Management) where the system should allow users to manage account statuses, including suspending and deactivating accounts.

Object 3: Backup Task
State Transition Diagram (Mermaid syntax):

stateDiagram
    [*] --> Pending
    Pending --> InProgress: Backup started
    InProgress --> Completed: Backup successful
    InProgress --> Failed: Backup failed
    Completed --> [*]
    Failed --> Pending: Retry triggered

Explanation:
Key States:

Pending: The backup task is scheduled but hasn't started.
InProgress: The backup task is ongoing.
Completed: The backup task has finished successfully.
Failed: The backup task has failed due to an issue.

Transitions:
InProgress: The backup starts when the task is triggered.
Completed: The task successfully completes.
Failed: The task fails due to some issue.
Retry triggered: If the backup fails, a retry may be triggered, transitioning it back to "Pending."

Mapping to Functional Requirements:
This supports FR-004 (Backup Process), where the system should handle the backup processes and retry failed tasks automatically.

Object 4: Database Replica
State Transition Diagram (Mermaid syntax):

stateDiagram
    [*] --> Synchronizing
    Synchronizing --> Synchronized: Sync successful
    Synchronizing --> Failed: Sync failed
    Synchronized --> Active: Ready for failover
    Failed --> [*]
    Active --> [*]

Explanation:
Key States:

Synchronizing: The database replica is in the process of syncing with the primary database.
Synchronized: The replica has fully synced with the primary database and is ready for failover.
Failed: Syncing failed, and the replica is not usable for failover.
Active: The replica is actively being used for failover in the event of primary database failure.

Transitions:
Synchronized: Triggered once the replica syncs successfully.
Failed: Triggered if the sync process encounters issues.
Active: Triggered once the replica is ready for failover and is active.

Mapping to Functional Requirements:
This addresses FR-003 (Failover Mechanism), where the system should allow automatic failover to a replica database during downtime.

Object 5: Transaction
State Transition Diagram (Mermaid syntax):

stateDiagram
    [*] --> Pending
    Pending --> Committed: Payment confirmed
    Pending --> Canceled: Payment failed
    Committed --> [*]
    Canceled --> [*]

Explanation:
Key States:

Pending: The transaction is pending and waiting for a confirmation action (e.g., payment).
Committed: The transaction has been confirmed and is final.
Canceled: The transaction was canceled, either due to a failure or a user action.

Transitions:
Committed: Triggered when payment is confirmed and the transaction is processed successfully.
Canceled: Triggered when the transaction fails, or the user cancels it.

Mapping to Functional Requirements:
This supports FR-007 (Transaction Management), where the system should allow users to cancel transactions or confirm them successfully.

Object 6: System Event Log
State Transition Diagram (Mermaid syntax):

stateDiagram
    [*] --> Logged
    Logged --> Archived: Logs archived periodically
    Archived --> [*]

Explanation:
Key States:

Logged: Events are being logged in the system.
Archived: The logs are archived after a certain time or upon reaching a threshold.

Transitions:
Archived: Triggered when logs are archived for future reference or to comply with retention policies.

Mapping to Functional Requirements:
This relates to FR-006 (System Monitoring), where the system logs all events and stores them in an archived state to ensure compliance and provide audit trails.

Object 7: Security Alert
State Transition Diagram (Mermaid syntax):

stateDiagram
    [*] --> Unresolved
    Unresolved --> Resolved: Alert handled
    Unresolved --> Ignored: Alert ignored
    Ignored --> [*]
    Resolved --> [*]

Explanation:
Key States:

Unresolved: The security alert is active and requires attention.
Resolved: The security threat has been addressed and resolved.
Ignored: The alert is not addressed and has been ignored.

Transitions:
Resolved: Triggered when the alert is dealt with.
Ignored: Triggered if the alert is ignored or dismissed.

Mapping to Functional Requirements:
This supports FR-009 (Security Monitoring), where the system should monitor security alerts, resolve or ignore them based on severity.

Conclusion
These state transition diagrams provide a detailed lifecycle for key objects in the AI-Driven Automated Database Recovery System. By modeling these objects and their transitions, we can better understand how each component of the system operates and interacts with other parts of the infrastructure. This also ensures that functional requirements are met and the system behaves as expected under different conditions.
