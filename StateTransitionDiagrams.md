# Object State Modeling with State Transition Diagrams 

Define State Transition Diagrams
- For each object, I'll describe its states, transitions, and events, using UML-style notation (you can later diagram them using tools like Lucidchart, Draw.io, or PlantUML).


### Identify Critical Objects
8 critical objects in the system:

1. Backup Job
2. Recovery Request
3. AI Failure Prediction Model
4. User Account
5. Notification
6. Database Node
7. Approval Request
8. Incident Report


Object 1: Backup Job
Mermaid Diagram

stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Scheduled
    Scheduled --> Running : onStart
    Running --> Completed : onSuccess
    Running --> Failed : onFailure
    Scheduled --> Canceled : onCancel

Explanation

Key States: Scheduled, Running, Completed, Failed, Canceled
Transitions: Triggered by system events like onStart, onSuccess, onFailure, onCancel
Functional Mapping: Addresses FR-001: "System must allow for scheduled backups and log their execution outcomes." The Canceled state handles interruptions.

Object 2: Recovery Request
Mermaid Diagram

stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Untrained
    Untrained --> Training : startTraining
    Training --> Trained : trainingComplete
    Trained --> Validated : validateModel [accuracy > threshold]
    Validated --> Deployed : deployModel
    Deployed --> Retired : retireModel

Explanation

Key States: Created, UnderReview, Approved, Rejected, Executed, RolledBack
Transitions: Driven by manual and system decisions, often based on permissions and resource availability
Functional Mapping: Supports FR-004: "Allow users to submit and approve recovery requests." Guard conditions ensure only valid users can approve.

Object 3: AI Failure Prediction Model
Mermaid Diagram

stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Untrained
    Untrained --> Training : startTraining
    Training --> Trained : trainingComplete
    Trained --> Validated : validateModel [accuracy > threshold]
    Validated --> Deployed : deployModel
    Deployed --> Retired : retireModel

Explanation

Key States: Untrained, Training, Trained, Validated, Deployed, Retired
Transitions: Triggered by AI model lifecycle operations
Functional Mapping: Maps to FR-008: "Model should only be deployed after validation with sufficient accuracy."

Object 4: User Account
Mermaid Diagram

stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Registered
    Registered --> Active : verifyEmail
    Active --> Suspended : suspendAccount [violationsDetected]
    Suspended --> Active : reactivateAccount
    Active --> Deactivated : userDeletesAccount

Explanation

Key States: Registered, Active, Suspended, Deactivated
Transitions: Controlled by user actions and admin interventions
Functional Mapping: Matches FR-002: "Enable account suspension and reactivation based on behavior."

Object 5: Notification
Mermaid Diagram

stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Created
    Created --> Sent : triggerNotification
    Sent --> Delivered : onSuccess
    Sent --> Failed : onError

Explanation

Key States: Created, Sent, Delivered, Failed
Transitions: Reflect delivery pipeline events
Functional Mapping: Addresses FR-007: "System should notify users about job status and failures."

Object 6: Database Node
Mermaid Diagram

stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Online
    Online --> UnderMonitoring : startMonitoring
    UnderMonitoring --> PredictedFailure : AI alert [confidence > 80%]
    PredictedFailure --> Offline : nodeShutdown
    Offline --> Maintenance : scheduleMaintenance
    Maintenance --> Online : completeMaintenance

Explanation

Key States: Online, UnderMonitoring, PredictedFailure, Offline, Maintenance
Transitions: Driven by AI alerts, system checks, and admin actions
Functional Mapping: Links to FR-010: "Enable predictive shutdown and maintenance scheduling."

Object 7: Approval Request
Mermaid Diagram

stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Draft
    Draft --> Submitted : submitApproval
    Submitted --> Approved : approve [validApprover]
    Submitted --> Declined : decline
    Approved --> Archived : archiveApproval
    Declined --> Archived : archiveApproval

Explanation

Key States: Draft, Submitted, Approved, Declined, Archived
Transitions: Represent approval workflow logic
Functional Mapping: Meets FR-003: "Support for request approval with appropriate access control."

Object 8: Incident Report
Mermaid Diagram

stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Reported
    Reported --> Acknowledged : acknowledgeIncident
    Acknowledged --> InProgress : assignTechnician
    InProgress --> Resolved : resolveIssue
    Resolved --> Closed : verifyResolution

Explanation

Key States: Reported, Acknowledged, InProgress, Resolved, Closed
Transitions: Triggered by incident handling steps
Functional Mapping: Relevant to FR-006: "All system incidents should be tracked and resolved systematically."
